🚀 **Built in 12 Hours | Powered by Google AI Studio & Gemini API**

## 🖼️ Project Overview

Our team participated in the **Technophilia 2025 AI Hackathon** at MIT College, Aurangabad, and developed a powerful AI software that transforms UI **images or sketches into frontend boilerplate code** (HTML/CSS). This tool empowers developers and designers by automating the process of converting wireframes or UI mockups into clean, production-ready code.
